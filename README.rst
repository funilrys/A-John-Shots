A John Shots (Hash To JSON)
===========================

A tool to get the Security Hash Algorightms (SHA) of all file in a given path.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of this project is to provide a tool which give the SHAx representation of all file in a given tree/path.

    A John Shots - A tool to get the Security Hash Algorightms (SHA) of all file
    in a given path.

    optional arguments:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        -a ALGORITHM, --algorithm ALGORITHM
                                The SHA algorithm to use. Can be ALL, SHA1, SHA224,
                                SHA384 or SHA512 (default).
        -d DESTINATION, --destination DESTINATION
                                Set the file we are going to write the JSON output to.
        -e EXCLUDE, --exclude EXCLUDE
                                The (regex) pattern the filename has to match in order
                                to be excluded from the output.
        -p PATH, --path PATH  The file or directory path to read.
        --print               Print the output.
        -s SEARCH, --search SEARCH
                                The (regex) pattern the filename has to match in order
                                to be included into the output.
        --save                Save the output into a JSON file.
        -v, --version         show program's version number and exit

    Help on function get in a_john_shots:

    a_john_shots.get = get(file_or_dir_path, sha='sha512', search=None, save=False, save_destination=None, exclude=None)
        Return the SHA representation of the given path children.

        .. note::
            If :code:`file_or_dir_path` is a directory, we will get
            the SHA representation of all children files.

        .. note::
            If :code:`file_or_dir_path` is a file, we will get
            the SHA representation of the given file.

        :param file_or_dir_path: The file or directory we are working with.
        :type file_or_dir_path: str

        :param sha:
            The SHA to use. Can be one of the following:
            ::

                - all
                - sha1
                - sha224
                - sha384
                - sha513
        :type sha: str

        :param search:
            The pattern the filename have to match in order to be
            taken in consideration.
        :type search: str

        :param save:
            Tell the system if we are allowed to save the result into a JSON file.

            .. note::
                The default file name is :code:`faith-slosh.json`.

            .. note::
                Even if this argument is set to :code:`True`, we return the
                dict representation if needed.
        :type save: bool

        :param save_destination: The destination file.
        :type save_destination: str

        :param exclude:
            The pattern the filename have to match in order to be
            excluded.
        :type exclude: str|list
